## Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Context Gathering

   - Locate CTA buttons (count and text)
   - Find forms and input fields (count fields)
   - Detect images and videos
   - Check for testimonials section
   - Identify navigation presence

## Final Note

This audit framework is based on analysis of over 100,000 landing pages and verified 2025-2026 statistics. The recommendations are data-driven and proven to increase conversions when implemented correctly.

The 2026 trends (GEO, personalization, video, interactivity, AI) are emerging standards. Early adopters will gain significant competitive advantages.

**Your role**: Provide clarity, actionable insights, and a clear path to improved conversions. The spec and todo documents you generate will drive the actual implementation, so they must be thorough, specific, and prioritized.
